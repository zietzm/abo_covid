## Background

The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) has spread rapidly across the glob and has caused over **\*\*\*** confirmed infections and over **\*\*\*** deaths worldwide as of **\*\*\***, 2020.
A number of risk factors for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are known, including age, sex, and several conditions and laboratory findings (**Several citations here**).

Recent work has demonstrated an association between ABO blood types and COVID-19 risk.
Using data from Wuhan and Shenzhen, Zhao et al. found a greater proportion A and a lower proportion of O blood types among COVID-19 patients, relative to the general populations of Wuhan and Shenzhen [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.11.20031096].
(**Other studies as examples here too**)

Blood types occur with varying frequencies across populations.

(**Why blood type could matter, possible confounding due to ancestry**)

The ABO blood type trait reflects polymorphisms within the *ABO* gene.
This gene is associated with a number of other traits, including risk factors for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.
For example, genome-wide association studies have associated variants within *ABO* to activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) [@doi:10.1038/tpj.2009.70], red blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, [@doi:10.1038/ng.531; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.042; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.11.016; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0047-6], von Willebrand factor [@doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.869156; @doi:10.1002/ana.23838; @doi:10.1038/ejhg.2015.222; @doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034532], myocardial infarction [@doi:10/fms4dn; @doi:10.1038/ng.3396], coronary artery disease [@doi:10.1038/ng.784; @doi:10.1161/STROKEAHA.113.002707; @doi:10.1038/ng.3396; @doi:10.1038/ng.3913; @doi:10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.117.312086], ischemic stroke [@doi:10.1002/ana.23838; @doi:10.1161/STROKEAHA.113.002707; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0058-3], type 2 diabetes [@doi:10.2337/db16-1253; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04951-w; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0241-6], and venous thromboembolism [@doi:10.1182/blood-2008-11-190389; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0025581; @doi:10.1111/j.1538-7836.2012.04810.x; @doi:10.1002/gepi.21731; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.01.019; @doi:10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.116.001643; @doi:10.1182/blood.2019000435; @doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0519-3].
A 2012 meta-analysis found that, in addition to individual variants, a non-O blood type is among the most important genetic risk factors for venous thromboembolism [@doi:10.1055/s-0032-1315758].
Moreover, coagulopathy is a common issue for COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.1111/jth.14817; @doi:10.1111/jth.14869; @doi:10.1111/jth.14888; @doi:10.1016/j.thromres.2020.04.024; @doi:10/ggx259; @doi:10.1055/s-0040-1710018; @doi:10.7326/M20-2003], and risk of venous thromboembolism must be carefully managed [@doi:10.1016/j.jvs.2020.05.015; @doi:10.1016/j.jvs.2020.05.015].
The associations between these conditions and both blood type and COVID-19 provide reason to believe true associations may exist between blood type and morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19.


Within the United States, New York suffered among the worst outbreaks during the early phases of the pandemic.
As of **\*\*\***, New York has recorded **\*\*\*** confirmed infections and **\*\*\*** deaths.
We sought to understand the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 and blood type using electronic health record (EHR) data from New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP/CUIMC) hospital in New York, USA.
We compared both ABO and Rh(D) blood types, and we investigated initial infection status and two severe COVID-19 outcomes: intubation and death.
We evaluated potential confounding due to population stratification using a multivariate analysis, and we report clinically meaningful measures of effect.

## Results

We determined blood types using laboratory measurements recorded in the NYP/CUIMC EHR system.
After removing likely errors, such as individuals with contradictory blood type results, we identified 14,112 individuals with known blood type who received at least one SARS-CoV-2 swab test (Table 1).
Individuals with a single positive test were considered COV+, even if they had previous or subsequent negative tests.
Individuals were considered initially COV+ if they first tested positive on their first recorded test or within the following 96 hours.
We evaluated associations between blood types and outcomes using three comparisons: infection prevalence among initial tests, and survival analysis for intubation and death among infected individuals.
We report data as of August **\*\*\***, 2020.

### Prevalence among initial tests

(**Why did we look at this?**)

We evaluated the prevalence of infection among individuals during their first encounters at NYP/CUIMC.
To account for the high rate of false negative tests and the fact that providers treated likely patients as COVID patients regardless of an initial test result, we treated any positive test during the first 96 hours as evidence of initial infection.

We compared infection prevalence between groups using reference groups O for ABO and Rh-positive for Rh(D).
Since blood type frequencies vary across ancestry groups (**¿Source?**), we computed both unadjusted and race/ethnicity-adjusted effect estimates.
Comparing unadjusted and adjusted estimates allows us to evaluate the degree and direction of confounding due to ancestry.



### Survival analysis for intubation and death

To understand whether blood type affects progression to disease outcomes over time, we examined intubation and death using survival analysis with competing risks.
We considered death and recovery as competing events for intubation and recovery as a competing event for death.
Cohort entry was defined as the time of a patient's first positive test result or the start of a hospital encounter if the first positive test occurred during the first 96 hours of the hospitalization.
In accordance with CDC guidelines (**¿Source?**) and provider practice (**¿Source?**), we defined a patient as having recovered only when 10 days had passed since the patient entered the cohort and only once the patient had been discharged.
Patients outcomes beyond **\*\*\***, 2020 were censored.

We used the Fine-Gray model [@doi:10.1080/01621459.1999.10474144] to estimate cumulative incidence functions by blood type, and we computed risk differences, numbers needed to treat (NNT), and bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for these estimates [@doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.03.012].

![Estimated risk differences for blood types during the period from March 10 to August 1, 2020.
Values represent risk differences for each blood type relative to the reference groups (O for ABO and positive for Rh(D)).
Prevalence risk differences were computed using linear regression, while intubation and death were computed using the Fine-Gray model [@doi:10.1080/01621459.1999.10474144].
Differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) computed using Austin's method and bootstrap [@doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2009.03.012].
Adjusted models include race and ethnicity as covariates.

## Discussion

These results are consistent with an association discovered for SARS-CoV-1 [@doi:10.1001/jama.293.12.1450-c], in which O blood groups were significantly less common among SARS patients.


## Methods

We considered EHR data up to **\*\*\***, 2020.
We conducted our analyses using the R language.
While our data from NYP/CUIMC are protected by HIPAA and cannot be released, we have made all code used for our analysis available at <https://github.com/zietzm/abo_covid_analysis>.
The manuscript was written [openly on GitHub](https://github.com/zietzm/abo_covid) using Manubot [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].
